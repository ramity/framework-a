					Introducing the Challenge : Ramity.com
				</h1>
				<p class="blogtextfull">
					During the last few years, ramity.com has been the location for all my hopes, dreams, and aspirations to become a reality.
					While on this journey of programming and design, I've learned a multitude of skills and tricks to help supplement my more difficult projects come to light.
					Everything from e-Commerce to blogs to basic forums and thread websites to full fledged social media websites.
					You name it, I've tried it at-least once.
					But here I am again wielding the knowledge I've learned from all my failures and successes.
					I'm here to make my own history as a full stack web developer, broaden my horizons, and maybe thicken that wallet of mine.
					But there's a catch 21 at my own expense: college.
					So here I am, trying to make something in roughly less than 2 months that can rival all other social media networks at this time.
					Myself being the only programmer. This could be an interesting challenge... Let's start shall we?
